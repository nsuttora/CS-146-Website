		<h2 class="title"> Time Management </h2>
		<ul class="tips">
			<li> 	<span class="tips-bold">Make a Plan.</span> It's never too early to start figuring out how you'll do all the work in 
					each of your five classes. In fact, the very first day of classes is the right time. 
					Enter all the assignments—including weekly assignments, quizzes, and exercises or short 
					papers—into your electronic or print calendar. Then develop a plan for both your run-of-the-mill 
					weekly studying and the mondo research paper or killer final. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Keep a Log.</span> Especially at the beginning of the semester, you should track how long it takes you
					to do the homework in each of your classes, prepare for quizzes and tests, and write short papers.
					Knowing this can help you plan the time frame for future course assignments. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Do Your Homework on Time.</span> Even though there's no parent or teacher to stand over you, be sure you're
					doing the outside-of-class work when it's assigned. Doing the reading in advance of the lecture,
					studying for each quiz as it comes along, and memorizing what needs to be memorized on a week-by-week
					basis are all strategies that will increase your efficiency and cut down on overall study time. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Divide and Conquer.</span> Break up larger projects, such as research papers, field studies, and cumulative
					finals, into manageable chunks. And spread the stages over a reasonable number of days. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="title"> Studying Techniques </h2>
		<ul class="tips">
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Learn How to Create a Distraction-Free Zone.</span> A study on workplace distractions found that it takes
					workers an average of 25 minutes to return to what they were working on pre-interruption. Try
					turning off your phone notifications or blocking Twitter (temporarily) on your computer so you
					can concentrate on the homework tasks at hand. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Look Over Your Notes Each Night.</span> Fill in details, edit the parts that
					don’t make sense, and star or highlight the bits of information that you know are most important.
					Interacting with your notes will help you remember them. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Don’t Over-Study.</span> Make sure you’re studying the key ideas of each lecture or textbook chapter, and
					avoid absorbing useless information. If you’re not sure, meet with your professor to make sure you’re
					practicing good study habits. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Take a Break.</span> Take a ten-minute break every hour or so, and try to take a day or two off per week
					if you can. It’ll help you stay energized and at peak mental condition. Given how easy it is to become
					overwhelmed in college, this is probably the most important of our study tips for college students. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="title"> Note-taking Skills </h2>
		<ul class="tips">
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Take the Notes You Can’t Get Elsewhere.</span> People scrambling to write down everything they see in a
					PowerPoint presentation might cause them to miss all the important points a speaker says aloud —
					when those are often the most important points to write down. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Make it Visual.</span> There's no shame in drawing charts or shapes if it aids your understanding. Whether
					you are writing or typing, find ways to add visual interest to your notes. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Review After Class.</span> Whenever possible, review your notes within a few hours to edit and expand on the
					notes that you took in class. An extra scan and adjustment of the notes you just took will allow
					the material to really take root in your brain. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Handwrite, Then Type.</span> Take notes by hand, and then type them up at the end of the day. This gives
					you a chance to polish them up a bit, have all the convenience of digital organization, and imbed
					the notes deeper into your memory while keeping the note-taking experience simple and tactile. </li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<div>
		<h2 class="title"> Confidence/Stress Levels </h2>
		<ul class="tips">
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Realize You're Not Alone.</span> Study shows that one-third of college students feel inadequate after the
					very first semester. The majority of students have had doubts at one time or another about their
					ability to do the work. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Reward Achievements.</span> Everyone feels better when they give themselves some recognition for a job
					well done, even a small accomplishment. The positive reinforcement will make it easier for you to
					study for next week's quiz. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Get Consistent Sleep.</span> Ideally, you’ll get eight hours of sleep each night, but it’s not just
					about quantity. If you get eight hours of sleep but don’t go to bed until 2 a.m. each night, your body
					is bound to feel out of whack. </li>
			<li>	<span class="tips-bold">Plan Alone Time.</span> Now that you have a roommate and lots of new college friends, you may get stressed out
					from the social overload. Find a place, such as a quiet corner of the library or the quad on a sunny day,
					and spend some relaxing time by yourself. Turn on your favorite playlist or read a book for pleasure. </li>
